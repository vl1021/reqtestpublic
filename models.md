# BulkDataAlertEvent

This record captures when an alert happens on the patient\'s device. The
goal of this event is to notify the follower that an alert was displayed
on a patient\'s device, and to also notify them when it has been
acknowledged by the user.

# BulkDataTxDiagnostics v1.0

This record contains the transmitter diagnostic data. This data includes
the application state of the transmitter, and the internal algorithm
states used to calculate the EGV. This data on the transmitter is
encrypted, so the phone application is expected to send the data from
different partitions to the server. The server will have the ability to
determine the key used to encrypt the data, and decode it.
